#JR's Various Greasemonkey Scripts

These are scripts I built for various reasons. Sometimes they were built to get around Stupid "security" features (Your UserAgent is a pretty good resource for determining if a page is valid, so why not let it fill in your info?), replacing comments with something more intellegent, and others of low to minimal value. 

Make of these what you will, but if you do, it'd be swell if you shared them.
